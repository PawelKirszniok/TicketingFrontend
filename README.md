## About
This is the frontend of a Ticketing System App. 

It uses Flask and a number of its extensions to display the information to the users. All the information is stored permanently on the backend side and accesible via a REST API. 

The service also caches some data temporarily in local memory. The service is hosted on pythonanywhere.
